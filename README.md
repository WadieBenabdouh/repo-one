CSS Flexbox is really handy when it comes to laying out a webpage.

Proud of these code lines >

```html
      <div class="description">
        <h2>Build The Community Your Fans Will Love</h2>
        <p>Huddle re-imagines the way we build communities. You have a voice, but so does your audience. Create connections with your users as you engage in genuine discussion</p>
        <a class="button" href="#">Register</a>
      </div>
```

```css
.section-container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-evenly;
}
```
